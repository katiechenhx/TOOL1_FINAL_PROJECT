    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Denver's Open Data Catalogue keeps an open record of traffic accidents from the past few years in their [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-traffic-accidents).  This data set can be used to possibly answer several inquiries:\n",
    "- Are traffic accidents in Denver on an upward or downward trend?\n",
    "- Are serious injuries or fatalites changing in any significant way?\n",
    "- Are fatalaties or injuries more likely when a certain type of vehicle is at fault? Is the struck vehicle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Other questions may arrise in exploratory data analysis.  This data set is only for traffic accidents in Denver.  It may be combined or compared against similar data sets for other major cities to characterize vehicle safetly in Denver against similar metropolitan areas."

    "The data set can be accessed by downloading a CSV or calling against the REST API.  Ultimately it is a large file of comma separated values, with 48 columnns.  Not all the columns will be of use - there is especially a lot of location/spatial data that will probably not be prudent to the goals of this data analysis.  The CSV file has been downloaded and is included in the git repository of this notebook.  To make comparisons with traffic data from other cities, similar data sets will need to downloaded (or to save on reposity space - access through a web api via a `curl` call).  Comparing this data set against [Denver Traffic Counts](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-traffic-counts) might also be useful to normalize the data against traffic density.
